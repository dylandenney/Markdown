### **🚀 GitHub Actions: The 80/20 Rule Course (Master 80% of Use Cases in 20% of the Time)**

This course is designed to help you learn **80% of GitHub Actions with just 20% of the effort**. Instead of overwhelming you with every detail, we'll focus on the core concepts, workflows, and real-world use cases that cover the vast majority of automation needs.

---

## **📅 Course Outline**

⏳ **Total Time Investment: ~6 Hours**

### **Module 1: Introduction to GitHub Actions (20 min)**

📌 **Goal:** Understand what GitHub Actions is and why it’s useful.

- What is GitHub Actions?
- Why use it? (CI/CD, automation, DevOps)
- Key components: **Workflows, Jobs, Steps, Actions**
- YAML basics (since workflows are defined in YAML)

🔨 **Hands-on:** Create your first workflow to trigger on `push`.

---

### **Module 2: Workflows & Triggers (40 min)**

📌 **Goal:** Learn how to structure workflows and when they execute.

- **Triggers:**
    - `push` / `pull_request` (common triggers)
    - `schedule` (cron jobs)
    - `workflow_dispatch` (manual triggers)
    - `workflow_run` (chaining workflows)
- **Workflow Structure:**
    - Define multiple jobs
    - Run jobs in parallel or sequentially
    - Using conditions (`if:`)

🔨 **Hands-on:**

1. Create a workflow triggered on `pull_request`.
2. Set up a scheduled workflow that runs every night.

---

### **Module 3: Runners & Environments (30 min)**

📌 **Goal:** Understand where workflows run and manage execution.

- **Types of runners:** GitHub-hosted vs. self-hosted
- **Runner OS:** Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Environment Variables and Secrets**

🔨 **Hands-on:**

- Use `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` to access repositories securely.

---

### **Module 4: Writing and Using Actions (1 hour)**

📌 **Goal:** Master reusable actions and how to use them effectively.

- **Built-in Actions:**
    - `actions/checkout@v4`
    - `actions/setup-node@v4`
- **Marketplace Actions:** Finding and using community actions.
- **Writing Custom Actions:** (Intro to JavaScript or Docker-based actions)

🔨 **Hands-on:**

1. Use `actions/setup-node` to install Node.js.
2. Write a **simple custom GitHub Action**.

---

### **Module 5: Caching, Artifacts, and Dependencies (40 min)**

📌 **Goal:** Speed up workflows and persist data between jobs.

- **Caching dependencies:** `actions/cache@v4`
- **Uploading/Downloading artifacts**
- **Matrix builds** (Run jobs across multiple environments)

🔨 **Hands-on:**

1. Cache dependencies for faster builds.
2. Store test reports as artifacts.

---

### **Module 6: CI/CD with GitHub Actions (1.5 hours)**

📌 **Goal:** Learn how to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline.

- **Building and Testing Code**
- **Deploying Applications**
    - Deploy to GitHub Pages
    - Deploy to AWS / Docker Hub / Firebase
- **Approval Workflow for Production Releases**

🔨 **Hands-on:**

1. Set up a **CI pipeline** for a Node.js app.
2. Deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.

---

### **Module 7: Security & Best Practices (50 min)**

📌 **Goal:** Secure your workflows and follow best practices.

- **Security Considerations:**
    - Use `secrets` instead of hardcoding tokens.
    - Restrict workflow permissions.
- **Linting and Formatting Code in PRs**
- **Using Dependabot for automatic updates**
- **Debugging and Monitoring Workflows**

🔨 **Hands-on:**

1. Use **Dependabot** to automate dependency updates.
2. Add a **linter check** to a pull request.

---

## **💡 Final Project (1 hour)**

📌 **Goal:** Build and deploy a **real-world** GitHub Actions workflow.

🔨 **Project:**

- Create a **CI/CD pipeline** that:
    - Runs tests on push
    - Deploys code to a **staging server**
    - Requires **manual approval** before deploying to **production**

---

## **🔥 Learning Strategy**

- 🏆 **Focus on hands-on practice** (Every module has a hands-on task)
- 📌 **Real-world scenarios** (CI/CD, caching, security)
- 🚀 **Optimize for impact** (Skip unnecessary details, focus on what’s used most)

After completing this course, **you'll be able to automate workflows like a pro and confidently use GitHub Actions in your projects**. 🎯
